# Denial

The goal of this level is to deny the owner from withdrawing funds from `Denial` when they call the function `withdraw()`. The issue with the `withdraw()` function is that it is vulnerabile to DOS attacks, hence why the level is named "Denial". The function `setWithdrawPartner()` is public, allowing anyone to call the function and become a partner. Once we are a partner, we can call `withdraw()`. The `withdraw()` function makes two external calls: to the `partner` address and the `owner` address, transfering 1% of Ether to each. This is problematic insofar the `partner` address is called first without any sort of return check or specified gas value. Without a specified gas value, `call()` forwards all the gas along with the call. Here, we could drain the remaining gas in a `fallback()` or `receive()` function when we receive the funds. This would drain all the remaining gas and prevent further execution.

To pass this level, simply deploy the `AttackDenial` contract in `AttackDenial.sol`, passing in the instance address to the `constructor()`. This sets your smart contract's address as a partner and consumes any gas forwarded to it once it recieves funds.
